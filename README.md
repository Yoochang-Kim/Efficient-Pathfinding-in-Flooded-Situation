# FloodPathfinder

## Introduction
The C program simulates a pathfinding robot in a flood scenario. It uses Dijkstra and A* algorithms to find the shortest path to reach destination.

## How It Works
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path on a map.
- **A* Algorithm:** Uses heuristics to find a path quickly.
