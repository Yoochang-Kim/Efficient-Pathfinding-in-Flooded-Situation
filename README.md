# FloodPathfinder

## Introduction
The C program simulates a pathfinding robot in a flood scenario. It uses Dijkstra and A* algorithms to find the shortest path to reach destination.

## Feature
- Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path calculation.
- A* Algorithm for efficient pathfinding with heuristic.
- Adjustable map dimensions (recommended to keep under 20 for optimal performance).
- The map includes buildings, walls, road and water
- Buildings and walls are impenetrable obstacles.
- Water and roads have different traversal costs, affecting pathfinding.
